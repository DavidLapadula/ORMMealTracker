# Burger Store ORM

This is a full stack web application with a simple, personally designed, implementation of object relational mapping. The user may add a burger of their choosing to the list, and then 'devour' it if they choose. The application is designed within the 'Model-Viewer-Control' paradigm of system architecture.

## Motivation

Hacing built various Full Stacl applications, this project was intended to supplement previous work by introducing a database (mySql) and tem[plating engine. These tools were very effective for data persistency (on the back end) and dynamic data rendering (on the front end). Given the growth of the web and move towards comprehensive web applications, and understanding of such tools is critical for all developers.
