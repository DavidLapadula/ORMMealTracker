# Burger Store ORM

This is a full stack web application with a simple, personally designed, implementation of object relational mapping. The user may add a burger of their choosing to the list, and then 'devour' it if they choose. The application is designed within the 'Model-Viewer-Control' paradigm of system architecture.
